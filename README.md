This is a little side-project of mine to experiment with scatt files. I'm currently working on a bigger scatt analysis project, tho it's still set on private. If you want some detail, dm me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@AriOnIce24)

I only tested the project with scatt pro files. Feel free to fork and edit the scripts

To run the vbs converter:

```sh
%windir%\SysWoW64\cmd.exe

cscript vbscriptfile.vbs
```
